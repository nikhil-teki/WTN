The Default working directory will be the Project main folder.
So, to work with files without specifying the path of the file in the program code,
Change the working directory of the java program to the file folder.
To change the working directory goto 
"run configurations" -> "Arguements" -> "Working Directory" -> "Other".
After your work with the java program is finished,don't forget to change the working Directory back to Default.
